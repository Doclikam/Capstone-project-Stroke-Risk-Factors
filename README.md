Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in sub-Saharan Africa with increasing incidence. In Kenya, it is a neglected condition with a paucity of evidence despite its need for urgent care and hefty economic burden. Stroke prevention follows a similar principle of controlling these risk factors. Risk factors important in stroke prevention can be divided into non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. In most cases, the patient has a combination of modifiable risk factors: diet, lifestlye and non-modifiable factors such as age, gender, heart disease.


In this project we will explore how diffrent factors affect the risk of developing a stroke using data from 'healthcare-dataset-stroke-data'. This data can be used to predict the risk of developing a stroke based on diffrent factors including age, gender, smoking status and the presence of other conditions.



We will explore the following:
